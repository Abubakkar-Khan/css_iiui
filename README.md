## 1. Purpose

The CS Society portal is a full-stack web application that serves as the digital home for the Computer Science Society at IIUI. It provides:

- **Public pages** — homepage, events calendar, team roster, alumni directory, photo gallery, about, and contact form.
- **Admin CMS** — a protected dashboard where society executives can manage all content (events, news, team members, alumni, gallery images) without writing code.
- **Media pipeline** — image upload, storage, and delivery through Cloudinary CDN.
- **Contact system** — inquiry form backed by Resend email API with a simulation fallback for development.

## 3. Architecture Overview

The application follows a monolithic architecture within the Next.js App Router. Frontend pages, API route handlers, and server components coexist in a single deployment.

```mermaid

    Browser["Browser Client"]
    NextServer["Next.js Server"]
    Pool["pg.Pool Connection"]
    NeonDB[("Neon PostgreSQL")]
    CDN["Cloudinary CDN"]
    Resend["Resend Email API"]

    Browser -- "HTTP Requests" --> NextServer
    NextServer -- "Raw SQL Queries" --> Pool
    Pool -- "SSL Connection" --> NeonDB
    Browser -- "Direct Image Upload" --> CDN
    NextServer -- "Stream Upload / Delete" --> CDN
    NextServer -- "Email Dispatch" --> Resend
```

### Key Decisions

1. **Pure Raw SQL** — The project runs purely on raw SQL queries using the connection pool from the Node Postgres `pg` driver. There is no runtime ORM (no Prisma, no Sequelize) to ensure maximum database performance, full control, and query transparency.

2. **Server-side API boundaries** — API routes execute on the server, keeping environment credentials (database URLs, API secrets) out of client bundles.

3. **Decoupled media storage** — Images are uploaded to Cloudinary. Only the resulting CDN URLs are stored in the database. This keeps the database lightweight and backups small.

4. **Client-side rendering for data pages** — Most public pages use `'use client'` with `useEffect` + `fetch` to load data on mount. This keeps the initial page shell fast while data hydrates.

5. **PostgreSQL case sensitivity** — The database uses PascalCase table names and camelCase columns. All raw SQL queries use double-quoted identifiers (e.g., `"TeamMember"`, `"gradYear"`) to match the PostgreSQL case-sensitive system correctly.

---

## 4. Database Schema (ERD)

The database contains **6 tables** with one foreign-key relationship between `Image` and `Event`.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ADMIN {
        int id PK "Auto-increment"
        string email "Unique login identifier"
        string name "Display name"
        string password "bcrypt hash"
        datetime createdAt
        datetime updatedAt
    }

    EVENT {
        int id PK "Auto-increment"
        string title "Event name"
        text description "Rich-text body"
        datetime date "Scheduled date"
        string locationType "OFFLINE | ONLINE"
        string venue "Physical address or URL"
        string eventType "Workshop | Seminar | Hackathon | Speaker Session | Other"
        string registrationLink "External registration link"
        datetime createdAt
        datetime updatedAt
    }

    IMAGE {
        int id PK "Auto-increment"
        string url "Cloudinary CDN URL"
        string caption "Optional description"
        int eventId FK "Nullable"
        datetime createdAt
    }

    NEWS {
        int id PK "Auto-increment"
        string title "Headline"
        text details "Body content"
        datetime date "Publication date"
        string imageUrl "Cover photo URL"
        datetime createdAt
        datetime updatedAt
    }

    TEAM_MEMBER {
        int id PK "Auto-increment"
        string name "Full name"
        string designation "Role title"
        text details "Short bio"
        string imageUrl "Portrait URL"
        string instagram "Handle"
        string linkedin "Profile URL"
        string facebook "Profile URL"
        datetime createdAt
        datetime updatedAt
    }

    ALUMNI {
        int id PK "Auto-increment"
        string name "Full name"
        string gradYear "Batch e.g. 2024"
        string company "Employer"
        string role "Job title"
        string imageUrl "Portrait URL"
        string linkedin "Profile URL"
        int priority "Sort weight, lower is first"
        datetime createdAt
        datetime updatedAt
    }

    EVENT ||--o{ IMAGE : "has many"
```

### Table Relationships

- **Event → Image** — one-to-many. Each event can have multiple gallery images. `Image.eventId` is a nullable foreign key; when set, the image belongs to that event. When `NULL`, the image is a standalone gallery asset.
- **Cascade delete** — deleting an Event automatically deletes all its associated Images (both from the database and from Cloudinary).
- **All other tables** are independent with no foreign-key constraints.

## 7. Sequence Diagrams

### CRUD Operations Pattern

All resource endpoints (team, alumni, news, gallery) follow the same pattern:

**Create:**
1. Admin uploads image via `POST /api/upload-url` → receives Cloudinary URL
2. Admin submits form via `POST /api/{resource}` with the URL in the payload
3. Server inserts row with `INSERT INTO ... RETURNING *`
4. Client receives created object and refreshes the list

**Update:**
1. Admin modifies fields and optionally uploads a new image
2. `PUT /api/{resource}/[id]` fetches the existing row
3. If `imageUrl` changed, the old Cloudinary asset is deleted via `deleteObject()`
4. Row is updated with `UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE "id" = $1 RETURNING *`

**Delete:**
1. `DELETE /api/{resource}/[id]` fetches the existing row
2. Cloudinary asset is deleted if a URL exists
3. Row is deleted with `DELETE FROM ... WHERE "id" = $1`

### Cloudinary URL Parsing (for deletion)

When deleting a Cloudinary asset, the server extracts the `public_id` from the URL:

```
Input:  https://res.cloudinary.com/cloud/image/upload/v123456/css_iiui/abc123.jpg
                                                         ───────────────────────
Step 1: Split on "/upload/" → "v123456/css_iiui/abc123.jpg"
Step 2: Strip version prefix → "css_iiui/abc123.jpg"
Step 3: Remove extension    → "css_iiui/abc123"
Result: public_id = "css_iiui/abc123"
```

# PostgreSQL connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=require"

# Cloudinary credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"

# Optional: Resend email API key (omit for simulation mode)
# RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_key_here"
```

### Step 3 — Database Setup

Initialize the tables and seed the default admin account:

```bash
node scripts/db-setup.mjs
```

This script connects to your PostgreSQL instance using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, creates all 6 tables if they do not exist, and seeds the default administrator account.

### Step 4 — Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Step 5 — Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Database Management

All schema changes are handled via standard SQL operations (such as executing `ALTER TABLE` statements directly). You can use Node.js scripts using the `pg` pool driver to apply schema updates or migrations.
